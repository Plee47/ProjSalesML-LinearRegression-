# ProjSalesML-LinearRegression-
This is a Python project using machine learning with linear regression as the foundation for sales prediction. The model takes into account the investment value and predicts the quantity of sales. The program uses Scikit-learn library for the machine learning part and NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems and can be used as a starting point for developing more complex models that can take into account a larger number of variables and factors.
